Write a GUI-based program that plays a guess-the-number game in which the user guesses a number between 1 and 100 and the computer provides the responses. The window should display the user’s guesses with a label by saying, “Too large, try again,” or “Too small, try again.” When the user finally guesses the correct number, the program congratulates him and tells him the total number of guesses


import tkinter as tk
import random

target_number = random.randint(1, 100)
attempts = 0  # Counter for number of attempts


def check_guess():
    global attempts
    try:
        guess = int(entry_guess.get())
        attempts += 1

        if guess < target_number:
            label_result.config(text="Too small, try again!", fg="blue")
        elif guess > target_number:
            label_result.config(text="Too large, try again!", fg="blue")
        else:
            label_result.config(text=f" Correct! You guessed it in {attempts} tries!", fg="green")
            button_submit.config(state="disabled") 
    except ValueError:
        label_result.config(text="Invalid input! Enter a number.", fg="red")


root = tk.Tk()
root.title("Guess the Number Game")


label_instruction = tk.Label(root, text="Guess a number between 1 and 100:")
entry_guess = tk.Entry(root)
button_submit = tk.Button(root, text="Submit", command=check_guess)
label_result = tk.Label(root, text="", fg="black")


label_instruction.pack(pady=5)
