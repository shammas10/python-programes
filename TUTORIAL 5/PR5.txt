Consider the above student.csv file with fields Name,Branch, Year, CGPA .
Write python code using pandas to 

To find the average CGPA of the students
To display the details of all students having CGPA > 9
To display the details of all CSE students with CGPA > 9
To display the details of student with maximum CGPA
To display average CGPA of each branch


import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("student.csv")

avg_cgpa = df["CGPA"].mean()
print("1) Average CGPA of all students:", round(avg_cgpa, 2))

high_cgpa_students = df[df["CGPA"] > 9]
print("\n2) Students with CGPA > 9:\n", high_cgpa_students)

cse_high_cgpa = df[(df["Branch"].str.upper() == "CSE") & (df["CGPA"] > 9)]
print("\n3) CSE Students with CGPA > 9:\n", cse_high_cgpa)

max_cgpa = df["CGPA"].max()
top_students = df[df["CGPA"] == max_cgpa]
print("\n4) Student(s) with Maximum CGPA:\n", top_students)

avg_cgpa_branch = df.groupby("Branch")["CGPA"].mean()
print("\n5) Average CGPA of Each Branch:\n", avg_cgpa_branch)
