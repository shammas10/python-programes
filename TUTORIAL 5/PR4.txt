Consider a CSV file ‘employee.csv’ with the following
columns(name, gender, start_date ,salary, team)
Write commands to do the following using panda library.

2. print all employee names in alphabetical order
3. find the name of the employee with highest salary
4. list the names of male employees
5. Display to which all teams employees belong



import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("employee.csv")

print("1) First 7 Records:\n", df.head(7))

print("\n2) Employee Names in Alphabetical Order:\n", df['name'].sort_values().reset_index(drop=True))

highest_paid = df.loc[df['salary'].idxmax()]
print("\n3) Employee with Highest Salary:\n", highest_paid['name'])

male_employees = df[df['gender'].str.lower() == 'male']['name']
print("\n4) Names of Male Employees:\n", male_employees.reset_index(drop=True))

unique_teams = df['team'].unique()
print("\n5) Teams Employees Belong To:\n", unique_teams)
