Given a file “auto.csv” of automobile data with the fields index, company,
body-style, wheel-base, length, engine-type, num-of-cylinders, horsepower
average-mileage, and price, write Python codes using Pandas to
1) Clean and Update the CSV file
2) Find the most expensive car company name
3) Print all toyota car details
4) Print total cars of all companies
5) Find the highest priced car of all companies
6) Find the average mileage of all companies
7) Sort all cars by Price column ( university question)
